          I imagine that the day you were born was a day of great celebration,
          and I’m sorry I wasn’t there. But today, we are together, and we can
          celebrate your birthday in grand style. You deserve the best in the
          world, my personal PHARM!
          <br />
          <br />
          For today, dance as though no one is watching you, Love as though you
          have never loved before, Sing as though no one can hear you, Live as
          though heaven is on earth! You’ve been faced with trials and
          tribulations; joys and sorrows! But you have always made the best out
          of what you had, even when there wasn’t much at all.
          <br />
          <br />
          Everything has led you to this moment, where a strange young man, who
          hardly knows you, writes a long birthday paragraph for you just
          because he wants her to know how much he loves her!
          <br />
          <br />
          I’m not known for plenty writing but my wish for your birthday is for
          you to enjoy every day to the fullest. I thank heaven for all of the
          amazing things that come your way. I love you, happy birthday. For a
          lot of years, I was lonely and I was just pretending to be happy. But
          then you came along and everything changed. You have helped me realise
          how special the world is, and I don’t have to pretend anymore. Enjoy a
          solid year and continue to be the best at what you do - plus let
          CHRIST remain in the first place and he’d handle the rest.
          <br />
          <br />
          For that and for everything else, thank you and Happy Birthday, FAV!
